excerpt: "Gap analysis and implementation support for the NIS2 directive and the Swedish Cybersecurity Act."
introLead: >
  The NIS2 directive and the Swedish Cybersecurity Act represent the most sweeping
  changes in cybersecurity for Swedish organisations in over a decade.
  We help you navigate the requirements and build real resilience.
introduction: |
  The NIS2 directive introduces new and strengthened cybersecurity requirements for essential and important entities across the EU. The Swedish implementation through the Cybersecurity Act imposes concrete obligations regarding risk management, incident reporting, supply chain security, and management accountability.

  Many organisations know they fall within scope but lack a clear picture of what actually needs to be done. The requirements span technical, organisational, and legal dimensions — and the sanctions are substantial.

  Verit helps you understand exactly which requirements apply to your organisation, identify gaps against your current state, and build a realistic plan to achieve compliance. We combine deep regulatory expertise with hands-on implementation experience and our platform Securapilot for ongoing monitoring.

faq:
  - question: "How do we know if our organisation falls under NIS2?"
    answer: >
      NIS2 covers essential and important entities across 18 sectors.
      Determining factors include your sector affiliation, the size of your
      organisation, and whether you provide services vital to society. We can help
      with a quick assessment during a complimentary introductory call.
  - question: "What distinguishes NIS2 from the original NIS directive?"
    answer: >
      NIS2 significantly expands the number of sectors in scope, introduces stricter
      security requirements, tightened reporting obligations (24 hours for
      an initial notification), and grants supervisory authorities enhanced sanctioning powers.
      Management accountability is also clarified — executives can be held personally liable.
  - question: "How long does it take to become NIS2-compliant?"
    answer: >
      It depends on your organisation's current maturity level. A typical
      implementation takes 3–6 months from gap analysis to baseline
      compliance. With Securapilot you can then maintain and continuously improve
      your security posture on an ongoing basis.
