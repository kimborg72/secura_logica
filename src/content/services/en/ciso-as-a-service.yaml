excerpt: "An interim security leader providing strategic direction without a full-time hire."
introLead: >
  Not every organisation needs a full-time CISO — but every organisation needs
  strategic security leadership. Our CISO-as-a-Service gives you access to
  experienced expertise at the level you need.
introduction: |
  A Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is responsible for driving an organisation's information security programme at a strategic level. The role demands deep expertise across technology, risk, and governance — and finding the right person as a full-time hire is both difficult and costly.

  With CISO-as-a-Service you gain access to an experienced security leader who works as part of your organisation, but at the scope that suits your needs. From strategic advisory to board reporting and operational support.

  Our CISO service is not a generic consulting role. We immerse ourselves in your business, your challenges, and your objectives — and then build a security programme tailored to your specific organisation. We report directly to your executive team and take ownership of progress.
targetAudience:
  heading: "Do you need a CISO?"
  description: >
    The need for a CISO is growing in step with regulatory requirements and the threat landscape.
    If you lack dedicated security expertise at the leadership level, or if your
    current resource needs reinforcement, we can help.
  segments:
    - "Mid-sized companies without a dedicated CISO"
    - "Fast-growing technology companies"
    - "Public sector and municipalities"
    - "Organisations subject to NIS2 requirements"
    - "Companies in a growth or restructuring phase"
benefits:
  - title: "Immediate expertise"
    description: >
      Instead of a recruitment process spanning 3–6 months, you gain immediate
      access to an experienced CISO with a proven track record in
      management systems, regulatory compliance, and security governance.
  - title: "Flexible engagement"
    description: >
      We scale the engagement to your needs — from one day per week to
      a more comprehensive role during intensive periods such as
      NIS2 implementation or certification projects. You pay
      for the time you actually need.
  - title: "Strategic and operational"
    description: >
      Our CISO operates at every level: from the boardroom and
      executive presentations to hands-on work with risk assessments,
      policies, and incident management. You get a complete solution
      that bridges strategy and practice.
process:
  - step: 1
    title: "Needs assessment"
    description: >

      picture of what type of engagement is needed.

  - step: 2
    title: "Onboarding"

      and your stakeholders. We establish working methods, reporting lines,
      and priorities for the first months.
    duration: "2–3 weeks"
  - step: 3
    title: "Ongoing delivery"
    description: >
      Regular presence in your organisation. We drive the security programme

      and ensure that your objectives are met.
    duration: "Ongoing"
  - step: 4
    title: "Knowledge transfer"
    description: >
      We document and transfer knowledge continuously. If you
      eventually wish to hire a permanent CISO, we support you with
      recruitment and handover.
    duration: "Continuous"
deliverables:
  - "Information security strategy tailored to your business"
  - "Regular management reporting and board presentations"
  - "Risk assessments and incident support"
  - "Policies and governing documents"
  - "Knowledge transfer to internal resources"
  - "Supervisory and audit preparation"
faq:
  - question: "How much time does an external CISO spend with us?"
    answer: >
      It varies by need. Typically 1–2 days per week
      as a baseline engagement, with the option to scale up during intensive
      periods. We always tailor the scope to your situation.
  - question: "Can an external CISO report to our board?"
    answer: >
      Absolutely. We regularly present to executive teams and
      boards, with reports tailored to the audience.
      Strategic decision-support material, risk status, and progress reports
      are a core part of the delivery.
  - question: "How does this differ from a traditional consultant?"
    answer: >
      A traditional consultant often delivers a report and moves on.
      Our CISO service involves an ongoing commitment where we take
      ownership of progress, drive the work forward, and remain available
      to your organisation over time.
