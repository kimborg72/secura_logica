excerpt: "Systematic risk analysis and information classification tailored to your business."
introLead: >
  Effective information security starts with understanding your risks. Without
  systematic risk management, decisions are made blindly — resources are misallocated
  and the real threats remain unaddressed.
introduction: |
  Risk management is the foundation of all information security work. It is through risk assessments that you identify which threats are relevant to your specific business, evaluate likelihood and impact, and make well-informed decisions about which measures are needed.

  Information classification complements risk management by giving you a clear picture of which information is most worthy of protection. When you know what is critical, you can direct resources appropriately and avoid applying equal protection to everything.

  We help you establish a risk management process that provides management with decision-support material and gives the organisation a clear direction for its security efforts. Our risk assessments are not academic exercises — they result in concrete measures with clear responsibilities and timelines.
targetAudience:
  heading: "Do you need systematic risk management?"
  description: >
    Risk management is a requirement under NIS2, ISO 27001, and GDPR — but
    above all it is a tool for making better decisions
    about where to invest in security.
  segments:
    - "Organisations implementing NIS2"
    - "Companies on the path to ISO 27001"
    - "Businesses with high information sensitivity"
    - "Organisations that have experienced incidents"
    - "Public sector organisations"
    - "Companies looking to prioritise security investments"
benefits:
  - title: "Risk-based decisions"
    description: >
      Prioritise security efforts based on actual risk exposure,
      not gut feeling. You receive clear decision-support material showing
      where the risks lie, how severe they are, and which measures
      deliver the greatest impact.
  - title: "Regulatory compliance"
    description: >
      Risk management is a cornerstone of NIS2, ISO 27001, and GDPR.
      Our methodology meets the requirements of all three frameworks
      and produces documentation that holds up under audit and supervision.
  - title: "Resource optimisation"
    description: >
      Invest in security measures where they deliver the greatest value.
      Through systematic risk assessment you avoid
      over-dimensioning protection in the wrong places and under-dimensioning
      it where it is truly needed.
process:
  - step: 1
    title: "Risk identification"
    description: >
      We identify threats, vulnerabilities, and information assets
      through workshops and interviews with key personnel
      from the business and IT.
    duration: "1–2 weeks"
  - step: 2
    title: "Risk analysis & assessment"
    description: >
      Systematic evaluation of likelihood and impact using
      established methodology. We assess each risk and present
      the results in a risk matrix.
    duration: "1–2 weeks"
  - step: 3
    title: "Risk treatment"
    description: >
      We develop recommended measures with clear responsibilities, timelines,
      and follow-up points. Each risk receives a treatment plan
      that you can start acting on immediately.
    duration: "1 week"
  - step: 4
    title: "Ongoing monitoring"
    description: >
      Implementation in Securapilot for continuous risk monitoring
      and reporting. Risks are re-evaluated regularly and
      treatment plans are followed up automatically.
    duration: "Ongoing"
deliverables:
  - "Risk analysis report with assessed risks and risk matrix"
  - "Risk register with treatment plan"
  - "Information classification model"
  - "Classification guide for employees"
  - "Management presentation with risk landscape and recommendations"
faq:
  - question: "What methodology do you use for risk analysis?"
    answer: >
      We use a methodology based on ISO 27005 and ISO 31000,
      adapted for information security. The methodology is sufficiently
      rigorous to meet regulatory requirements yet sufficiently
      pragmatic to deliver practical results.
  - question: "How often should a risk analysis be updated?"
    answer: >
      The risk analysis should be reassessed at least annually, but also
      in response to significant changes in the business, IT environment, or
      threat landscape. With Securapilot you can make ongoing
      updates instead of large point-in-time efforts.
  - question: "What is information classification?"
    answer: >
      Information classification means categorising your
      information according to how sensitive it is. Common levels
      are public, internal, confidential, and strictly confidential.
      The classification determines which protective measures are required
      for each information type.
