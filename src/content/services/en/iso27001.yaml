introLead: >
  ISO 27001 is the international standard for information security and
  is increasingly required in procurement and client relationships. We guide
  you from baseline assessment to certification.
introduction: |
  An information security management system (ISMS) in accordance with ISO 27001 provides your organisation with a structured framework for protecting information. The standard is recognised globally and demonstrates to clients, partners, and authorities that you take information security seriously.

  ISO 27001:2022 includes updated controls that reflect the current threat landscape — with a focus on cloud security, threat intelligence, and data protection. Certification requires systematic effort but delivers significant benefits in the form of strengthened trust and reduced risk.

  Verit has extensive experience building management systems that not only pass certification audits but actually work in day-to-day operations. We tailor the effort to your organisation's size and maturity and ensure that security work becomes a natural part of your business.
targetAudience:
  heading: "Is ISO 27001 right for you?"
  description: >
    ISO 27001 certification is relevant for all organisations that handle
    sensitive information, but especially for those facing requirements from clients,
    regulators, or procurement processes.
  segments:
    - "IT and technology companies"
    - "SaaS providers"
    - "Financial sector"
    - "Public sector"
    - "Management consultancies"
    - "Healthcare and e-health"
benefits:
  - title: "Structured security management"
    description: >
      An ISMS gives you clear processes for risk management, incident management,
      and continuous improvement. Instead of ad hoc efforts, you gain
      a systematic approach that the entire organisation can follow.
  - title: "Competitive advantage"
    description: >
      An increasing number of clients and procurement bodies require ISO 27001 certification.
      The certificate demonstrates that you meet an international standard
      and opens doors in both public and private business.
  - title: "Regulatory foundation"
    description: >
      ISO 27001 provides a solid foundation for meeting requirements from NIS2,
      GDPR, and industry-specific regulations. The standard systematically covers
      the areas that most regulatory frameworks require.
process:
  - step: 1
    title: "Baseline assessment"
    description: >
      We map your existing security measures, processes, and
      documentation against ISO 27001:2022. The result shows exactly
      what needs to be built or improved.
    duration: "2–3 weeks"
  - step: 2
    title: "Design & planning"
    description: >
      We design your management system — scope, policies, risk methodology,
      and control structure. Everything is tailored to your business
      and existing processes.
    duration: "3–4 weeks"
  - step: 3
    title: "Implementation"
    description: >
      Step by step, we implement the controls and processes
      required. We train key personnel and ensure
      that the system is embedded in the organisation.
    duration: "2–4 months"
  - step: 4
    title: "Internal audit & certification"
    description: >
      We conduct the internal audit, support management review,
      and prepare you for the external certification audit.
    duration: "3–4 weeks"
deliverables:
  - "Gap analysis report against ISO 27001:2022"
  - "ISMS documentation: policies, guidelines, and procedures"
  - "Risk assessment and risk treatment plan"
  - "Statement of Applicability (SoA)"
  - "Internal audit report"
  - "Support ahead of the external certification audit"
faq:
  - question: "How long does an ISO 27001 certification take?"
    answer: >
      A typical certification journey takes 4–8 months depending on
      the organisation's size and current maturity level. Smaller
      organisations with a limited IT environment can often achieve certification
      more quickly, while larger operations require more time.
  - question: "What does it cost to become certified?"
    answer: >
      The cost varies based on the organisation's size, scope,
      and existing maturity. The largest investment lies in
      consulting support and internal staff time, plus the certification body's
      audit fee. We provide an estimate after the baseline assessment.
  - question: "What is the difference between ISO 27001:2013 and 2022?"
    answer: >
      ISO 27001:2022 has restructured controls (from 114 to 93),
      new controls for cloud security, threat intelligence, and data masking,
      as well as a clearer focus on a risk-based approach. Existing certificates
      need to transition to the 2022 version.
