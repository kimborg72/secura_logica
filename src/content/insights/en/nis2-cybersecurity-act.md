On 1 January 2025, the Swedish Cybersecurity Act entered into force as an implementation of the EU's NIS2 directive. The act introduces strengthened cybersecurity requirements for organisations operating essential services.

## Who is in scope?

The Cybersecurity Act covers essential and important entities in sectors such as energy, transport, healthcare, drinking water, digital infrastructure, public administration, and several others.

## The key requirements

- **Risk management**: Organisations must carry out systematic risk assessments and implement proportionate security measures.
- **Incident reporting**: Significant incidents must be reported to the supervisory authority within 24 hours.
- **Management accountability**: Senior management bears personal responsibility for ensuring that requirements are met.
- **Supply chain security**: Organisations must consider security risks throughout their supply chain.

## What should you do now?

1. **Determine** whether your organisation falls within the scope of the Cybersecurity Act
2. **Conduct a gap analysis** against the new requirements
3. **Develop an action plan** with prioritised measures
4. **Implement** the necessary technical and organisational measures
5. **Monitor** on an ongoing basis using tools such as Securapilot
