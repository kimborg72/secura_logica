Information security has become a critical function in every organisation, but not all have the resources to hire a full-time CISO (Chief Information Security Officer). CISO-as-a-Service offers a flexible alternative that provides access to strategic security expertise without the fixed cost.

## What does CISO-as-a-Service involve?

An external CISO works part-time with your organisation and takes responsibility for:

- **Strategic advisory** — Develop and anchor your information security strategy with senior management.
- **The management system (ISMS)** — Establish and maintain your information security management system in accordance with ISO 27001.
- **Risk management** — Identify, analyse, and prioritise security risks.
- **Compliance** — Ensure compliance with NIS2, GDPR, and industry-specific requirements.
- **Incident management** — Build processes for handling security incidents.
- **Training** — Raise security awareness across the organisation.

## When is it the right choice?

CISO-as-a-Service is best suited for organisations that:

1. **Lack internal security expertise** — You need strategic leadership but do not have the volume for a full-time role.
2. **Are in a growth phase** — Requirements are growing faster than the organisation can recruit.
3. **Fall under new regulations** — NIS2 and the Cybersecurity Act require a responsible person, but the role does not need to be full-time.
4. **Want an independent perspective** — An external CISO can provide objective assessments free from internal politics.

## Advantages compared to an in-house CISO

| | In-house CISO | CISO-as-a-Service |
|---|---|---|
| **Cost** | SEK 80,000–120,000/month | SEK 25,000–50,000/month |
| **Availability** | Full-time | Contracted time + on-call |
| **Breadth of experience** | One industry | Multiple industries and frameworks |
| **Time to hire** | 3–6 months | Days |
| **Continuity** | Risk upon resignation | Contractual backup |

## How we work

Verit's CISO-as-a-Service model is built on three pillars:

1. **Current state analysis** — We map your existing security efforts and identify gaps.
2. **Action plan** — Together we prioritise measures based on risk and regulatory requirements.
3. **Ongoing support** — We participate in the management team, drive the security programme forward, and report to the board.

## Summary

CISO-as-a-Service is not a compromise — it is a strategic choice that gives mid-sized organisations access to the same security expertise as large enterprises, at a fraction of the cost. With increasing regulatory requirements through NIS2 and the Cybersecurity Act, the need has never been greater.
